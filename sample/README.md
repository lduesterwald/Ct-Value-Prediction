# Sample
This folder contains the following three files useful for testing and running the scripts in this repo:

* *ct_prediction_model.sav* - An example trained Ct value prediction model
* *kmr_dictionary.pkl* - An example dictionary used to create the matrix that the model was trained on
* *meta_data_file.csv* - A file containing the genome_ids, metadata, and GISAID IDs for every genome used to train the model

All genome files used to train the model can be downloaded from the [GISAID](https://gisaid.org/) database via their GISAID IDs. GISAID IDs for all genomes provided in the *metadata_file.csv* file.
